a detailed time series analysis and forecating for 2025 air pollution in delhi (using previous 15 years data)


Indicating Decrease in PM2.5 Value (Which Is Very Harmful to Human Health)
The decrease in PM2.5 levels from 284.57 µg/m³ in January 2023 to 48.28 µg/m³ in January 2025 is a positive sign,
but PM2.5 remains harmful to human health, causing respiratory and cardiovascular issues.
This reduction could reflect improvements in air quality due to factors like pollution control or changes in industrial activities.

However, the prediction model only considered specific pollutants and does not account for other factors like weather, socio-economic changes,
or other pollutants (e.g., NO2, CO, SO2) that could still pose risks.
While the drop in PM2.5 is encouraging, a more comprehensive analysis is needed to fully understand air pollution and its impact on public health.
